# sqlalchemy-challenge
module 10 hw
In this challenge, I received help from my tutor with creating the sessions within my jupyter notebook. I got help with the code to receive the last 12 months of data. 
I also got help from my tutor with creating the app. I received help with the code on the first query, and I used the internet and chatgpt as well as the first query to help me write all the other queries within the app.
